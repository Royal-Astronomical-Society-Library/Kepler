# Basic usage

## Image

Johannes Kepler was a German mathematician and astronomer. He was also a leading exponent of the Copernican heliocentric system. He is most famous for his laws of planetary motion. A contemporary of Galileo, he succeeded Tycho Brahe as imperial mathematician in Prague. In 1609 he established the geometrical basis of the laws of planetary motion using Braheâ€™s observations. He also carried out research on cosmic harmonies, celestial physics and optics.[^1]
